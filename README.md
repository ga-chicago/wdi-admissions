## Frequently Asked Questions

* **What type of computer/operating system do I need to use?** General Assembly has a technology policy that requires the use of Mac OS X. We require a Mac that is newer than a 2010 model and that is capable of running Mac OS X 10.9 (versions prior will result in issues that would require troubleshooting) or newer. If you're running an older version of OS X, you should upgrade to at least OS X 10.9 prior to orientation. 
* **What are the minimum hardware specs?** 4GB of RAM, at least 10GB free of space on your hard drive, and an x86 or x64 processor.
* **What's the best price on a Mac?** Apple has an [official refurbished site](http://www.apple.com/shop/browse/home/specialdeals/mac). We have seen Macbooks as low as US$750 on it before. And yes, we do recommend AppleCare and there is an Apple Store 4 blocks away that can perform same-day service if you have it.
* **Can I use Linux?** Yes, if you can:
  - Install it yourself
  - Research terminal commands for Linux (ps: try to learn as much as you can prior)
  - Understand our staff will assist you when we are available to.Some issues have to wait until after lectures
  - Are comfortable living on the wild side
  - You've used Linux in the past (maybe you're a PHP/MySQL kind of person)
* **What version of Linux would you suggest for a newbie?** We recommend Linux Mint (with Cinnamon) or Ubuntu if you are new to Linux. Both are easy to get started with.
* **Can I run WDI in a virtual machine?** Yes, if you can:
  - Install it yourself
  - Configure your own networking adapters
  - Allocate at least 4GB of RAM to your virtual machine

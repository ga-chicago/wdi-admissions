## Frequently Asked Questions

* **What type of computer/operating system do I need to use?** General Assembly has a technology policy that requires the use of Mac OS X. We *highly* recommend a Mac that is newer than a 2008 model and that is capable of running Mac OS X 10.9 (versions prior will result in issues that would require troubleshooting). Because we strive to teach modern development techniques
* **Can I use Linux?** Yes, if you can:
  - Install it yourself
  - Research terminal commands for Linux (ps: try to learn as much as you can prior)
  - Understand our staff will assist you when we are available to.Some issues have to wait until after lectures
  - Are comfortable living on the wild side
  - You've used Linux in the past (maybe you're a PHP/MySQL kind of person)
* **What version of Linux would you suggest for a newbie?** We recommend Linux Mint (with Cinnamon) or Ubuntu if you are new to Linux. Both are easy to get started with.
* **Can I run WDI in a virtual machine?** Yes, if you can:
  - Install it yourself
  - Configure your own networking adapters
  - Allocate at least 4GB of RAM to your virtual machine
